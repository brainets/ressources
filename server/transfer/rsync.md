# Transfer data using rsync

Rsync is a tool that allows you to synchronize your data between a source and a destination folder.

To transfer data between mesocentre and frioul it's better to connect to the mesocentre and use rsync from there, 
while if you want to transfer files between mesocentre and your PC it's better to launch rsync commands from
your local bash.

## Basic usage example

A classic use of rsync is in the form of:

    rsync -av /path/source/ /path/destination/
    
We will see the synopsis of the options in the next chapter.
    
If you're using a remote computer/cluster you should add its address.
For example, our friend Olof BabbÃ© have to enxchange some file from frioul to mesocentre.
After connecting to the mesocentre, he will **start an interactive session** and then:
* if he wants to send files from mesocentre to frioul:

        rsync -av /home/obabbe/data/ babbe.o@frioul.int.univ-amu.fr:/hpc/equipe/babbe.o/data
        
* while if he wants to send files from frioul to mesocentre:

        rsync -av babbe.o@frioul.int.univ-amu.fr:/hpc/equipe/babbe.o/data/ /home/obabbe/data
        
> **N.B.**: pay attention to the slashes at the end of the source/destination directory. 
> To write '../data/' means 'what is in the folder data', while writing '../data' means 'the folder data itself'.
> Thus in the previous command line we are saying to synchronize the content of '../data' from the source, 
with the content of '../data' in the destination. 
Indeed, to understand this mechanism, the last command line can be written also as:   
>    ```rsync -av babbe.o@frioul.int.univ-amu.fr:/hpc/equipe/babbe.o/data /home/obabbe/```

## Useful options

### Basic synopsis

Now we will see some usefull option for rsync and their usage.

* -a: archive mode, for the sake of brevity this is a 'powerful' recursive option, that allows to recursively 
transfer files/directories and to keep track of their changes (e.g. updated files). 
High recommended instead of the recursive option.
* -r: recursive, used to synchronize source/destination folder and their subfolders and files.
* -v: verbose, it will print what is going on during the synchronization
* -m: prune empty folders, to avoid the synchronization of empty folders. 
Very useful in case of exclusions (next section).
* -n: dry run, you're not sure about the result of your rsync command? Try it with a dry run first! 
Executing a rsync -avn command will show you which file will be synchronized and where, 
without actually transferring anything.

### Include/exclude options

A more efficient way to transfer just the file you're interested in, is to use the --include and --exclude options.

* --include='fname': normally all files are included when you use rsync, the include option is used if you're
excluding a folder but you want to include some files in it
* --exclude='fname': this option is used if you want to exclude some file or folder from the synchronization
* --exclude-from='exclusion_file.txt': this option is really helpful if you have a list of file to exclude. 
This option allows you to write a list of file to exclude in a txt file and to use it to sync files.

Imagine the scenario in which there is a main folder data, inside thiss folder there's two subfolders called 
'folder_1' and 'folder_2', that contains rispectively the files 'file_1' and 'file_2'.

If you want to synchronize file_2 but not file_1, one way to do it would be to write:

    rsync -avm --progress --stats --exclude='file_1' ../source/data/ ../destination/data
    
In this case you're telling rsync to sync everything but 'file_1'
    
Otherwise you can write:

    rsync -avm --progress --stats --include='*/' --include='file_2' --exclude='*' ../source/data/ ../destination/data
    
In this case you're telling rsync to exclude everything but 'file_2'. The option --include='*/' is needed to include
the passage into the subfolders. 

> **N.B.**: the option --exclude='*' should be used after all the inclusions are declared

A third option is to make a txt file that contains just the one line 'file_1', and then write:

    rsync -avm --progress --stats --exclude-from='exclusion_file.txt' ../source/data/ ../destination/data
